# Peer-to-Peer Learning Platform

## 📌 About the Project

This is my first complete full-stack web application built from scratch.  
The main goal of this project was to understand how frontend, backend, and database work together in a real application.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools Used

### Frontend
- React.js
- JavaScript
- Axios
- React Router

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- bcrypt.js
- CORS

### Tools & Applications
- MongoDB Atlas
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
- Node Package Manager (npm)

## 📚 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how a complete full-stack application works from start to finish.

I learned how to:
- Build a backend using Node.js and Express  
- Create and use REST APIs  
- Connect backend with MongoDB  
- Implement user authentication and password security  
- Build a basic frontend using React  
- Connect frontend and backend using HTTP requests  
- Debug real development errors  
- Use Git and GitHub for version control  

This project helped me understand the full-stack development workflow and gain confidence in building real applications.


## 🚀 Future Plans

This project is the foundation for a bigger application.  
In the future, I plan to add more features such as:

- Peer matching and collaboration  
- Messaging between users  
- Learning content sharing  
- Progress tracking  
- AI-based learning support  
- Better UI and user experience
